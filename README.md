Bulk Transaction Concurrency Simulator

Execute Concurrent Bulk Purchase Transactions on Domoblock

Welcome to the Bulk Transaction Concurrency Simulator, a Node.js utility crafted to stress-test and validate bulk purchase workflows on the Domoblock platform. By leveraging concurrent API calls, this tool helps you ensure reliability and performance under high-load scenarios.

Core Features

Concurrent Transactions: Execute multiple purchase requests in parallel.

Flexible Configuration: Environment-based settings via .env or custom config files.

Command-Line Controls: Debugging flags, balance checks, and token verifications.

Extensible Architecture: Modular codebase for easy enhancements and integrations.

Why Use This Simulator?

Traditional load tests may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns. This simulator:

Validates your APIâ€™s concurrency handling.

Identifies bottlenecks in Domoblock purchase flows.

Ensures token distribution logic remains intact under stress.

Motivation

Deepen System Resilience: Test edge cases for simultaneous transactions.

Performance Benchmarking: Measure throughput and latency under load.

Automation Ready: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
